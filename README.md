# Asteroid_Unity
 My own spin on the classic arcade game Asteroids.
 
## Motivation
Learning the Unity workflow as well as the basics of making games.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Unity](https://unity.com/)

## Game Installation
Currently there is no updated .exe to play the game. Placing the Asteroid folder in your Unity projects folder will allow you to open up the game editor.

## Credits
As much as possible I tried to link the relevant YouTube videos and StackOverflow pages I referenced/used in each script.
